# ðŸŽ¯ What You Need for Your First Post

## âœ… What You Already Have:
- âœ… Python environment set up
- âœ… All dependencies installed  
- âœ… Gemini API key (great for AI features!)
- âœ… .env file created
- âœ… Database ready

## ðŸš¨ What You Need to Provide:

### 1. Instagram Credentials (REQUIRED)
You need to add these to your `.env` file:

```env
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_actual_instagram_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_actual_instagram_password
```

**Important Instagram Requirements:**
- Must be a **Business** or **Creator** account (not personal)
- You need the actual username/password
- 2FA might need to be disabled temporarily
- Account should not be restricted

**To convert to Business account:**
1. Open Instagram app
2. Go to Settings â†’ Account
3. Switch to Professional Account
4. Choose "Business" or "Creator"

### 2. That's It! 
Everything else is optional or already configured.

## ðŸŽ‰ Once You Add Instagram Credentials:

**Test the system:**
```bash
python check_apis.py
```

**Create your first post:**
```bash
python main.py
# Then use MCP tools: scrape_news â†’ generate_post â†’ publish_post
```

## ðŸ’¡ Optional Enhancements:

**Better AI (you already have Gemini, but could also add):**
- OpenAI API key ($5-20/month) for GPT-4
- Anthropic API key for Claude

**Custom Content:**
- Add more news sources
- Create custom visual templates
- Modify posting schedules

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes:
- Never share your Instagram password
- Use a test Instagram account first if you prefer
- Keep API keys private
- Start with MAX_POSTS_PER_DAY=1 for testing

---

**Bottom Line:** Just add your Instagram username and password to the `.env` file, and you're ready to create your first automated news post! ðŸš€
