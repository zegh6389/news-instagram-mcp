# Instagram Location Authentication Guide
## Resolving "Suspicious Login from USA" Issues for Milton, Canada

### üö® Problem Description
You're experiencing Instagram blocking login attempts with the message "We stopped a suspicious login from the USA" when trying to authenticate your MCP server from Milton, Ontario, Canada.

### üá®üá¶ Canadian Location Solution

This guide provides a comprehensive solution to establish trusted Instagram authentication from your Milton, Canada location.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root with your credentials:

```bash
# Instagram Credentials
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password

# Location Context
LOCATION_CITY=Milton
LOCATION_PROVINCE=Ontario
LOCATION_COUNTRY=Canada
LOCATION_TIMEZONE=America/Toronto
```

### Step 2: Run Canadian Authentication Setup
Use our specialized Canadian authentication script:

```bash
python setup_canadian_auth.py
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Configure Canadian device profile (Samsung Galaxy S21 Canadian model)
- ‚úÖ Set Canadian locale (en_CA) and timezone (America/Toronto)
- ‚úÖ Use Milton, Ontario location context
- ‚úÖ Establish a trusted session from your location

### Step 3: Manual Instagram Login (IMPORTANT)
Before running automation, perform these manual steps:

1. **Web Browser Login**:
   - Open Instagram.com in your browser
   - Log in manually from the same device/network
   - Complete any security challenges
   - Stay logged in for at least 30 minutes

2. **Mobile App Login** (Recommended):
   - Install Instagram mobile app on the same device
   - Log in through the mobile app
   - Browse normally for 10-15 minutes
   - This establishes device trust

### Step 4: Handle Security Challenges

If you receive security emails or challenges:

#### Email Verification:
- Check email for "Login attempt from Canada" notifications
- Click "This was me" to approve the location
- Wait 10-15 minutes before retrying automation

#### SMS Verification:
- Ensure your phone number is verified on Instagram
- Respond to any SMS verification codes promptly

#### Two-Factor Authentication:
- If enabled, you may need to temporarily disable it
- Or implement 2FA code handling in your automation

### Step 5: Test Authentication
Run the test script to verify your setup:

```bash
python test_canadian_auth.py
```

- Evening: 7:00 PM ET
- Night: 9:00 PM ET

### 3. Content Localization

- Include Canadian hashtags (#Canada, #Ontario, #Milton)
- Reference Canadian time zones (ET, PT)
- Use Canadian news sources

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues
